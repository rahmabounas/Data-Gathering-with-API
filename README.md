# 🚀 NASA API Data Retrieval Project

## 📚 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to practice accessing and using NASA's **public APIs** to retrieve and manipulate **space-related data**.  
You will learn how to:

- Obtain and securely store an **API key**.
- Make **API requests** to retrieve data.
- Process the retrieved data into a **pandas DataFrame**.
- Export the processed data into a **CSV file** for easy sharing and analysis.

## 🛠️ Instructions

In this project, we focus on consuming public APIs available through NASA's official portal.

Here’s what you need to do:

1. **Access the NASA API Portal**  
   NASA has made a wide range of data, including images and scientific datasets, publicly accessible for developers and data professionals.

2. **Obtain Your API Key**  
   - Visit the [NASA API Portal](https://api.nasa.gov/).
   - Fill out the provided form with your personal information.
   - You will receive an email containing your **personal API key**.
   - **Important:** Store this API key securely for later use.

3. **Make API Requests**  
   Use your API key to authenticate your requests and fetch the desired space-related data from the available NASA endpoints.

4. **Data Processing**  
   Convert the retrieved JSON (or other formats) data into a **pandas DataFrame** for easy analysis and manipulation.

5. **Export to CSV**  
   Finally, export the DataFrame into a **CSV file** so that it can be shared or used in further projects.
